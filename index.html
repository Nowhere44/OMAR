<h1 class="font-bold text-center text-4xl  mb-20 text-white">MARINE LE PEN, FIGURE OF THE NATIONALISM SURGE IN FRANCE </h1>

<p class="mb-10 text-xl text-red-600 uppercase">By Omar Almoctar Coulibaly</p>

<p class="font-bold mb-4 text-white">Marine Le Pen is the president of the National Rally, a far-right French party. She is a candidate for the 2022 French presidential elections after she formerly presented herself in 2012 and 2017. Involved in politics since the age of 18, Marine le Pen has carved out an image for herself within the National Front, a party created by her father, Jean Marie Le Pen in 1972 and which she has been leading since 2011.</p> 

<p class="font-bold mb-4 text-white">Controversial, sovereigntist, the candidate inspired by Donald Trump renews the political offer of the RN for 2022 with these proposals:</p> 

<h1 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold text-white">Major reforms:</h1>

<ul class="text-blue-600">

  <li class=""> • Reduce France's contribution to the European Union budget. </li>
    <li class=""> • Urgently remove agricultural products from free trade agreements. </li>
    <li class="">• Withdraw from NATO's integrated military command.  </li>
    <li class="">• Replace state medical aid with “vital emergency aid” for foreigners.  </li>
    <li class=""> • Delete the birthright law  </li>

    <h1 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold text-black text-white">   Controversial reforms: </h1>

   <li class=""> • Expel foreigners who have not worked for a year. </li>

  <h1 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold text-white">  Ambitious reforms:</h1>

   <li class="">• Increase all wages by 10% up to three times the minimum wage, without increasing employer contributions.  </li> 
     <li class="">• Introduce retirement at age 60 with forty annuities and 1,000 euros in minimum monthly pensions.  </li> 
     <li class="">• Changing legal minimum age to 16  </li> 
     <li class="">  </li> 
</ul>

<p class="font-bold mt-2 text-white">Since she inherited the National front, she was repeatedly elected regional councillor, municipal councillor; and she even completed a mandate as a European deputy.
For 30 years, the far right has made nationalism, populism and fighting against immigration its credo to win over the electorate. She is known for her positions on those. In 2017, Le Pen made it to the second round against Emmanuel Macron.


Her professional career was brief. Lawyer by training, she joined the 23rd correctional chamber of the Paris tribunal de Grande instance between 1992-1993. There, she carried out her biggest trial (Contaminated Blood Case) and volunteered for immediate appearances. 

A political figure of hope for some with the demonization of the FN that has become the National Rally, a disappointing candidate for others, Marine Le Pen intrigues for her multiple reversals and contradictions, her lack of mastery of certain subjects, the manifest lack of preparation, the figure of RN seems embodying the candidate of lost causes or the hope of an old world on the new?</p>
